# About the Project
## The Problem
With more chains popping up everywhere, more small businesses are closing down. Many of the big chains all have a convenient mobile app for their customers to order food. However, for small business, the amount of money that would be spent on creating a mobile app does not justify not amount of extra revenue generated from a mobile app. Furthermore, the convenience of chains is that every corner you turn, it is available.

## Solution
GoLocal will help local cafe owners by providing a mobile ordering system. The goal is to provide customers an easy, efficient and convenient way of ordering. GoLocal will connect local shops so that customers can pick up their daily cup of coffee at any corner. This will help small shops compete with big chains such as Starbucks and Tim Hortons. Then, to retain and attract customers, GoLocal will implement a loyalty program and allow shops to post daily deals.
